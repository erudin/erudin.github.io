Hi, I'm Erus. I love everthing about Software Libre and Linux. I also love math, to code and games. I enjoy crocheting and painting my hair :)
Right now I'm a intern of Openstack thanks to the Outreachy organization and I'll be posting here my experience during the internship and also other things that are of my interest.
